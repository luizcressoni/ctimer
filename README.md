# ctimer

cTimer is a C++ class that can be ported over many platforms.
Current version is for the Arduino family.
It's handy when you need to trigger something ater some time is elapsed.
The class takes care of it without overheads and works fine even when a time counter (like Arduino's millis()) rools over.
